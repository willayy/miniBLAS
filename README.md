# miniBLAS
Small "Basic Linear Algebra Subsystem" for optimizing vector based operations in x86_64 based systems.

## Dependencies
* Assembly code is written in GAS syntax, so you need a GNU assembler to compile it. 
Recommend using the GNU assembler that comes with GCC. Also recommend using CMake to build the project.
